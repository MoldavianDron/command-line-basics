#FHS

FHS stands for the "Filesystem Hierarchy Standard," and it is a set of guidelines and standards for the layout of the file system in Unix-like operating systems. FHS defines the directory structure and the organization of files and directories within the file system, making it easier to maintain, administer, and share software and data across different Unix and Unix-like systems.
The FHS standardizes the directory structure in Unix systems, ensuring a consistent layout across different distributions, which helps software developers and system administrators work with various Unix-based operating systems more easily.

Here are some of the key directories and their purposes in the FHS:

  /: The root directory contains all other directories and files.
  
  /bin: Essential binary files required for system recovery and repair. These are essential for the system to function, even if only the root file system is mounted.
  
  /boot: Files required for booting the system, including the kernel, bootloader configuration, and initial RAM disk (initramfs).
  
  /dev: Device files, representing hardware devices or pseudo devices, which provide access to physical and virtual devices.
  
  /etc: Configuration files and directories used by the system and various applications.
  
  /home: User home directories, where individual users' personal files and directories are stored.
  
  /lib and /lib64: Libraries required for programs and shared by various system utilities.
  
  /media: Mount points for removable media like USB drives and CD-ROMs.
  
  /mnt: Mount points for temporarily mounted filesystems.
  
  /opt: Optional software packages, often used for third-party applications.
  
  /proc: A virtual filesystem providing information about processes and the kernel.
  
  /root: The home directory for the root user.
  
  /sbin: System binaries essential for system maintenance.
  
  /srv: Data for services provided by the system, such as web server data.
  
  /tmp: Temporary files that are typically cleared on system boot.
  
  /usr: User data and read-only application data. This includes a variety of subdirectories for binaries, libraries, documentation, and more.
  
  /var: Variable data, such as log files, mail spools, and cache data.

The Filesystem Hierarchy Standard is an important guideline for system administrators and software developers because it helps ensure consistency and portability across different Unix-based systems. Different Unix-like operating systems may adhere to the FHS to varying degrees, but it serves as a common reference point for filesystem organization.
